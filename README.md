## About this Project
Insurance fraud detection includes collecting data from previous history, preprocessing to clean and organize the data, 
splitting the dataset into train, validation & test data, and applying data mining algorithms & building the model. This project 
will apply the supervised algorithm to train the model. Here a user-checkable interface will be present to check whether the user input data for insurance is fraud.
